Here‚Äôs a **detailed enterprise-grade scope** for **SmartLoan Agent ‚Äì Autonomous Loan Underwriting Assistant**, designed for production readiness, compliance, auditability, and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control). This scope can serve as your blueprint for building a prototype or MVP.

---

## üè¶ **Project Name**: SmartLoan Agent  
**Domain**: Financial Services / Lending  
**Objective**: Automate end-to-end loan underwriting with explainable, compliant, and secure AI-driven decisioning.

---

## üîç **Core Capabilities**

### 1. **Multi-Agent Orchestration (LangGraph-based)**
- **Document Parser Agent**:  
  - Ingests PDFs, scanned images, bank statements, payslips.  
  - Uses Azure Form Recognizer + custom ML models for structured extraction.  
  - Outputs normalized JSON: `{income: 75000, employment_duration: "3y", debt_ratio: 0.35}`

- **Credit Scoring Agent**:  
  - Integrates with external bureaus (e.g., CIBIL via API) + internal behavioral data.  
  - Computes dynamic credit score using rule-based + ML hybrid model (e.g., XGBoost).  
  - Flags anomalies (e.g., income vs. lifestyle mismatch).

- **Risk Assessor Agent**:  
  - Evaluates risk tier (Low/Medium/High) using:  
    - Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio  
    - Payment history  
    - Employment stability  
    - Collateral (if applicable)  
  - Applies configurable risk policies (e.g., ‚ÄúReject if DTI > 0.5‚Äù).

- **Decision Explanation Agent**:  
  - Generates human-readable rationale using LLM (e.g., Azure OpenAI):  
    > ‚ÄúLoan approved: Strong credit history (score: 780), DTI ratio of 0.28, stable employment.‚Äù  
  - Complies with **Regulation B (ECOA)** ‚Äì no discriminatory language.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Enterprise-Grade Requirements**

### ‚úÖ **Security & Compliance**
- **RBAC Implementation**:
  | Role | Permissions |
  |------|-------------|
  | **Borrower** | Submit application, view status & explanation |
  | **Loan Officer** | View assigned applications, override *only with justification*, add notes |
  | **Underwriter (AI)** | Auto-decide (no human role) |
  | **Compliance Auditor** | Full read-only access, audit trail export |
  | **Admin** | Manage users, policies, model versions |

- **Data Protection**:
  - All PII encrypted at rest (Azure Blob Storage + CMK) and in transit (TLS 1.3).
  - Secrets (API keys, DB creds) stored in **Azure Key Vault**.
  - Zero raw document storage after parsing (retain only structured JSON + audit hash).

- **Auditability**:
  - Immutable log of:  
    - Input documents (hash only)  
    - Agent decisions at each stage  
    - Final decision + explanation  
    - Human overrides (with reason)  
  - Logs stored in **Azure Log Analytics** with 7-year retention.

### ‚úÖ **Architecture**
- **Frontend**: React (borrower portal) + Blazor (internal dashboard)
- **Backend**:  
  - **.NET Core 8**: Auth, RBAC, API gateway  
  - **Python (FastAPI)**: Hosts agent orchestration (LangGraph), model inference  
- **AI Layer**:  
  - Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o) for explanations  
  - Azure Machine Learning for credit scoring model  
  - Azure AI Search for policy retrieval (RAG for rule lookup)
- **Data**:  
  - **Azure SQL DB**: Application metadata, user roles, decisions  
  - **Cosmos DB**: Unstructured agent state (for LangGraph checkpoints)  
  - **Blob Storage**: Temporary document upload (auto-delete after 1h)

### ‚úÖ **Workflow & Governance**
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**:
  - Auto-approve: Low-risk (score ‚â• 750)  
  - Auto-reject: High-risk (score ‚â§ 550 or policy violation)  
  - **Escalate to Loan Officer**: Medium-risk (551‚Äì749)  
- **Model Versioning**:  
  - All models tracked via **Azure ML Model Registry**  
  - A/B testing support for new scoring logic
- **Explainability**:  
  - SHAP/LIME for credit model  
  - LLM-generated summary for end-user

## üì¶ **Prototype Scope (MVP)**

To build a **working prototype**, focus on:

### ‚úÖ **In Scope (MVP)**
- Simulated document upload (PDF ‚Üí JSON via mock parser)
- Hardcoded credit logic (e.g., `if income > 50k and score > 700 ‚Üí approve`)
- LangGraph workflow: 4-agent chain with state passing
- RBAC via Azure AD groups + .NET Core policy middleware
- Decision explanation using Azure OpenAI (prompt-engineered)
- Audit log to Azure SQL
- React frontend: Borrower form + status view

### ‚ùå **Out of Scope (MVP)**
- Real CIBIL integration (use mock API)
- Full SHAP explainability (use rule-based rationale)
- Document scanning (assume pre-structured JSON input)
- Kubernetes deployment (use Azure App Services)

---

## üß™ **Success Metrics (Prototype)**
- End-to-end decision in < 10 seconds
- RBAC enforced (e.g., borrower can‚Äôt see other apps)
- Audit trail complete for every run
- Explanation is clear, non-discriminatory, and traceable to inputs

---

## üìÅ **Deliverables for Prototype**
1. GitHub repo with:
   - `/backend-dotnet`: Auth, RBAC, API
   - `/agents-python`: LangGraph workflow, FastAPI
   - `/frontend-react`: Borrower portal
2. Azure ARM/Bicep template for infra
3. Postman collection for testing
4. Architecture diagram (C4 model)

This scope aligns with **enterprise AI best practices** (governance, audit, RBAC) and leverages your strengths in **Azure, .NET, Python, LangChain/LangGraph, and GenAI**. It‚Äôs production-ready in design but scoped for a **2‚Äì4 week prototype**.
